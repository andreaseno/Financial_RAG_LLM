    I am going to give you a users query that they are prompting to a financial chatbot. Take that query, and extract out the company
    or companies, year or years, and quarter or quearters that relate to the user's query. Then provide that information in three python lists in your response.
    
    Below is two examples of what your response should look like given an query.
    
    ### Example Query 1
    
    Query Structure:
    ```
    **Query**: <query>
                What is Apple's earnings in 2024?
                </query>
    ```
    
    Your Response:
    ```
    **Companies** = ['Apple']
    **Years** = [2024]
    **Quarters** = []
    ```
    
    ### Example Query 2
    
    Query Structure:
    ```
    **Query**: <query>
                Compare the average revenue of Tesla to Microsoft over the years 2022-2024
                </query>
    ```
    
    Your Response:
    ```
    **Companies** = ['Tesla', 'Microsoft']
    **Years** = [2022, 2023, 2024]
    **Quarters** = []
    ```
    
    ### Example Query 3
    
    Query Structure:
    ```
    **Query**: <query>
                How did Tesla perform during Q2 of 2024?
                </query>
    ```
    
    Your Response:
